//1)what are promises and why do we need them ?

Promises are the ideal choice for handling asynchronous operations in the simplest manner. They can handle multiple asynchronous operations easily and provide better error handling than callbacks and events. A promise can be created using Promise constructor. Promise constructor takes only one argument,a callback function.

promises are used to handle asynchronous operations donot create callback hells.
In promises there are 3 stages pending ,resolved,rejection.
